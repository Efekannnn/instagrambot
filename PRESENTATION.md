## ðŸŽ“ Interview Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you choose YOLO over other detectors?**
> "YOLO offers the best balance of speed and accuracy for real-time applications. YOLOv8 specifically provides excellent performance with 5-50ms inference time, making it suitable for production line deployment. I also considered Faster R-CNN for higher accuracy scenarios but prioritized real-time capability."

**Q: How would you handle different lighting conditions?**
> "I implemented a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline: CLAHE for contrast enhancement, bilateral filtering for noise reduction, and adaptive thresholding. The system also supports runtime calibration where reference images can be captured under actual conditions."

**Q: What if the model encounters new defect types?**
> "The system is designed for easy retraining. I included a training script that supports custom datasets in YOLO format. Using transfer learning, new defect classes can be added with relatively few examples (typically 100-500 images per class)."

**Q: How would you deploy this in production?**
> "For production deployment, I would: (1) Export the model to ONNX for faster inference, (2) Implement a REST API using FastAPI, (3) Add database logging for traceability, (4) Set up monitoring and alerting, (5) Containerize with Docker for easy deployment."

**Q: What about false positives?**
> "I implemented multiple filtering stages: confidence thresholding, area-based filtering, and NMS. The system also supports custom post-processing rules. In production, we could add a human-in-the-loop review for borderline cases and use that feedback for continual learning."
